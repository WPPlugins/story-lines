Add a list of story highlights at the top of your posts to let your readers really know what your story is all about.

== Description ==
One of the common features of online news stories is a section that displays two or three highlights from the story. This plugin makes it very easy for you to do just that. Story Lines allows you to add as many story lines as you want and place it anywhere within a post with a quick shortcode.

== Installation ==
1. In the WordPress Dashboard, go to “Plugins” -> “Add New” and search for “Story Lines” and click install and activate.
2. To add story lines for a post, go to the bottom post editor fill out the fields in the "Story Lines" section. If you don't fill out the float and size fields, the story lines display will have a 25% width and float to the left. The display will default to a 100% width when the screen size is smaller than 500px.
3. To add the shortcode to the post, go to the top of the visual editor and click the button with the “SL” on the far right of the top row of buttons.
